Difference between ADD, COMMIT, PUSH commands:

ADD command updates the index of the current folder by preparing objects in a staged status before commit.  
COMMIT command records the changes made to the local repository after they have been added.
PUSH command updates the remote repository of the associated objects updated in the local repository.
